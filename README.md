# Priority_Inversion

Simple Form - 
    Road is a shared resource for all vehicles but ambulances are considered as high priority vehicles so other vehicles give side to the ambulance and it will reach its destination with time. But Somehow a low priority vehicle does not provide a side to a high priority vehicle ambulance and an ambulance unable to reach its destination it's called priority inversion.
    Priority Inversion - 
    Situation where high priority tasks wait for low priority tasks.
//Donâ€™t use semaphore with different priority queue because there is no guarantee
